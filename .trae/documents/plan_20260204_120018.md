I will implement SweetAlert notifications and confirmations for the Letter features by leveraging the existing SweetAlert integration in `app.js`.

1.  **Global Notification Handler**:
    *   Update `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` to automatically display SweetAlert popups (`showSuccess` / `showError`) whenever a Laravel session flash message (`success` or `error`) is present. This ensures consistent feedback across all pages without repetitive code.

2.  **Surat Masuk & Surat Keluar**:
    *   Remove the old-style Blade alert banners (green/red boxes) from `resources/views/admin/letters/in/index.blade.php` and `resources/views/admin/letters/out/index.blade.php`, as they will be replaced by the new global SweetAlert popups.

3.  **Format Surat**:
    *   Update the "Delete" action in `resources/views/admin/letters/formats/index.blade.php` to use the `data-confirm` attribute. This triggers the existing `app.js` logic to show a SweetAlert confirmation dialog instead of the browser's native `confirm()` box.

This approach unifies the UI interactions and cleans up the view files.
